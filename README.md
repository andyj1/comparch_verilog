### Verilog 2-bit Paper Processor ECE151 Cooper Union
### Team Name: Aardvark; Members: Andy Jeong, Gordon Macshane, Brenda So

####Abstract
	This project aims to construct a circuit on Verilog Hardware Description Language whereby the paper processor (https://sites.google.com/site/kotukotuzimiti/Paper_Processor) is implemented. The Verilog code takes in the modules (.v) – checking, dff_reset_negedge, dff_reset_posedge, halt, increment, jno, programcounter, fulladder, memory – which take the inputs and outputs the data bits according to the primitive logic gates event-driven cases (always block) and time delays (#). The instruction.bin file takes in the instruction codes, which are picked out based on the logic, and determines the data output.

##### To compile, run and show waveform using gtkwave simulator:
	make –f Makefile
	
##### What is under Makefile?
	SOURCE = main_tb.v
WAVE = gtkwave
	all: 
		iverilog -o pp.vvp $(SOURCE)
		vvp pp.vvp
		$(WAVE) pp.vcd
	clean:
		rm -rf *.vvp *.vcd
#### Optional: 

##### To compile separately on terminal: 
	iverilog -o <objectname> main_tb.v

##### To run the compiled object file:
	vvp <objectname>
	
##### To change the instruction:
change the bits in instruct.bin
